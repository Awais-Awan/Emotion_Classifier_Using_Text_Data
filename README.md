# Emotion_Classifier_Using_Text_Data
This project demonstrates how to classify text into different emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) using machine learning techniques. The model is built using a deep learning architecture with TensorFlow/Keras, leveraging the power of text preprocessing, tokenization, padding, and a neural network to predict emotions from text data.
